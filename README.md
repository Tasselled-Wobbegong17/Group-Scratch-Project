# Group-Scratch-Project

Junior phase group scratch project

## Description

As a team of 4, we worked to develop a full-stack real-estate search application. Not Zillow is designed to give users access to a realtime nationwide search engine. Not Zillow authenticates it's users, pulls real-time data, and allows the user to filter by a variety of fields, securely and efficiently.

We are using the 'Realty in US' api on RapidAPI to get real estate listings.
